# IEEEtran Latex Template (COPS Variant with Examples)


This repository contains a document that serves as a template for how to write LaTeX documents in the COPS lab for IEEE venues.
This document introduces the `IEEEtran-COPS` document class, which extends the base `IEEEtran` document class with some useful additions that we have been frequently using in our lab throughout the years.
The changes are very small and incremental, please check the `IEEEtran-COPS.cls` file to inspect the minor differences.

This document also serves as a primer for students that are not too familiar with writing Latex documents yet.
It contains many examples of basic Latex usage that illustrate best practices for how to write good Latex.
