\section{Tables}

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{This is a basic table}
\label{tab:basic}
\input{tables/basic}
\end{table}

This section shows a basic example in Table~\ref{tab:basic}.
Creating nice looking tables in Latex is not difficult when basic rules are being followed.
I warmly recommend to study the article \emph{"Small Guide to Making Nice Tables"}~\cite{Pue08}, which give a very useful primer.

The most complex part of Latex tables is the \code{tabular} environment, because it can become very complex very fast.
As such, I recommend to treat it like a picture and just move it out of the main document.
